			 <p>I'm Gugulethu Mngomezulu, a Lady that does not believe in the impossibilities I love to explore the world and challenge my obstacles and overcome them all. I see myself as a successful Lady that has a motive to change the world and inspire young girls to believe in themselves and not based on what people say. "We are all on a race to reach our goals so they can be a reality, who are they to tell you it not possible?" - Gugulethu.
	     My love for Karate started when I was 7 years old was exposed to it at an early stage and I grew up loving it, it didn't only show me I could stand up for myself it showed me how to challenge the world and win and how to have a strong backbone and to be proud of myself and who I am. The best thing that ever happened to me was to get one of the best coach in Karate Shihan Bongani Gumede a well known person and one of the best trainer alive</p>
	     
	   <p>He didn't only teach me how to defend myself but to also know how to respect other people and also how to control myself and how to fight right and win with his experience I was able to do anything without doubting myself,After doing my sport in 2010 I was selected for a Sport Award it was held in the Empangeni Civic Center where every sport code was 
	     gathered,I was confused cause I was only 11 years old and I was the only young girl that was nominated it was just unbelievable.I was shocked but then you know a saying that says "God put you there for a reason be confident in that path you are on". At that age sitting amongst big people that where legends that had alot of experience in there sport field that had me doubting myself alot but guess what table turned</p>
	     The Mayor of Uthungulu District announced my name for the 'BEST ACTIVE WOMEN IN SPORT' It was amazing I can't even share the feelings I had knowing that my hardwork and traning finally paid off.
	     A moment of Glory I had after that moment I was attending alot of tournaments as I grew up until now as an 18 year old Lady I have obtain over 21 trophies and 15 medals from different provinces around South Africa. I feel blessed and humble for all my achievements. Therefore when my peers try their best to throw words of doubt to me it doesn't  matter cause I know my background and I stand up tall and I am proud to be doing what the 99% is not doing.</p>
	     
	<p> I don't know about you but I'm Dlakadla,Lubelo,Msuthu...my clan name shows that I'm not a quiter,I came in this world kicking and screaming when I was born therefore I have no problem doing it again. No peer,adults or anyone will tell me that what I do is only for a specific gender, I want to do what males do, I want to do what females do and I want to live a life that is not limited that has no ropes to hold me back.
	    As I had that mentally I was unstoppable believe <a href="http://me.My">me.My</a> love for sport increased in a high level I joined the Athletics in Granthem Park Primary School and I succeeded I would beat everyone and obtain the number one sport. Running was not my passion at that time but knowing that sport was making me shine made me feel better I became one of the &quot;Top Athletics Stars&quot; of Granthem Park Primary and made it on the newspaper.
	    Sport changed my life for the best, After thinking that was the end of me appearing on the newspaper I guess I spoke too soon about that but I got home and I received some amazing news I got selected to represent South Africa in Japan karate tournament when I was 13 years old I started traveling at a young age in primary I built my own Legacy in Granthem Park Primary and made it on the achievement board my history will never be forgotten 
	    I even obtained Full colours in Karate.</p>
	    
	<p> I received the &quot;SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL TRACKSUITS&quot; to <a href="http://wear.My">wear.My</a> life was full of joy and mixed emotions of happiness I recieved alot of sponsors from different places and support from people around my community, I was excited.
	    Coming back from Japan the first time I was thinking it the end but I spoke too soon I went to Japan Three times in different years!
	    I have to say I thank God for such a talent I have, my focus is based on achieving everything I desire and need. </p>
          
	<p>We can do anything as long as we rectify our mindset and focus on the right things and tell ourselves that no matter what happens we will persist until we succeed. The ones that are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do.We are the future leaders of the next generation but how will we do that if we can't even motivate ourseleves?. 
	   I don't only have the love of Sport by my side but I'm a Motivational Speaker it all started at the age of 18 years old in Church as a platform where I would
  	   talk to a large audience during big conferences where I would express myself share what I have been through with other people believe me it was amazing I didn't believe I had a voice for it,I literally made myself and  parents proud of me
	   It felt like I could change the world with my powerful words and the way I live my life.I'm an advanturous Lady I love to do want people say it impossible cause I strongly believe that word doesn't exist in my dictionary I love to explore everything cause I surround myself with people that edge themselves in doing the impossible, I don't what to be in the safe zone like the 99% I what to be a risk taker,a Lady that is flexible
	   in everything she does or touches turns into Gold believe me when I say it is indeed possible cause I'm already doing it. I have learnt how to talk less and do more in my life cause in zulu there is a saying that says " inkomo enomlomo kayinamasi" meaning that if you talk alot about what you want to do in life you end up not doing anything at all.</p>

	<p>My life has been nothing but an amazing journey each and every pain I go through I find strength to contiune and I will never rest until my name shines on one of the best or top successful Ladys in the world trust me I won't rest cause I'm determined and hungry for success and once you become hungry everything you do ends up having a meaning and a purpose.
	   In school I am hardworker, I edge myself to get the best results and study hard and obtain nothing but the best and my hardwork has always paid off and motivated me to do the best.Throughout this path I have embarked, my father has shown support and not only that he is a well known Boxing International Fighter during his early years  
	   and has now became one of the best coach and manager in University of Zululand his achievements in Sport made me understand the words of encouragements he would always share with  me and also train me at home so I could improve and sharpern every teachnique cause " Practice makes perfect".Not only was he my trainer but also a father to me and would always show me how unstoppable I'm and that will make me want to keep doing my best everyday.</p>

	   </p>
	
	<p> Knowing that my family faced alot of finicial problems having my mother the only bread winner in the family it was not that easy man but through her guidance I have learnt alot and I'm proud that we got to experience a chapter like that cause it made me learn that I must never give up cause this is temporary and how to not let failure bring me down but rather to give me the energy to keep trying until I succeed.Facing that alone at an early age up until now it made me understand that I only have myself and family I became
	    so hungry for success that I would draft everything down and start doing it step by step until I get to a point where I would understand it,having all those challenges it really didn't put me in a stage where I would loose control of my own life due to the fact that I needed money,but rather it gave me time to know myself and what I want in life and after that to embrace myself even more.After that scene I was working day and night hustling at school and reading books that will give me clear understanding of the Information Technology
            Industry. I was indeed driven about the business world and bettering Technology for the future.I live to inspire and conquer the world.I believe in myself too much my struggles,suffering and disappointments made me the person I am today.A young girl with endless goals and a vision lives in a world that has it own saying about her yet she rides alone to the top and will succeed no matter what. </p>

 
	<p> The love for Computer started when I was 15 years old I would play around with everything and my brother since he had the varsity knowlegde would share a bit of theory and pratical skills with me and I would keep doing it up untill I get it right, the journey was amazing  I tell you yet I still grow in it I got big plans for the future the sky is the limit for me. I will never stop working hard cause my vision is too big I want my name to shine big and become a role model to other kids out there.
	    Everything need commitment and endless practice therefore I give it my all to make sure that I get it perfect and right.I have already started with planning my own company and having some drafted up ideas for the future or should I say soon and that's all for now that I can say and share about my buisness side and life plans.</p>

	<p>Everything I have gone through was amazing I don't regret a thing the people in my life and the people that I know are just a blessing and I value them too much. Thank you so much for reading my story and I hope after this you will learn that everything is possible as long as you believe in yourself and not other people.
	   Success is a lonely ride you don't need friends all you need is yourself and trust the path you are on. No one will understand your grind because they don't have your vision therefore stay hustling !!</p>
